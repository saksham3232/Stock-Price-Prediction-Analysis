# Stock Price Prediction & Analysis

This project aims to predict and analyze stock prices using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. The repository leverages popular Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, and model building, making it a comprehensive toolkit for stock market prediction tasks.

## Features

- **Data Collection:** Utilizes financial APIs and local CSV data (e.g., `INFY.csv`) for historical stock price data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares time series data for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizes trends and patterns using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements models from scikit-learn for regression and prediction.
- **Deep Learning Models:** Leverages TensorFlow and Keras for building advanced neural networks.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Uses Streamlit for interactive model exploration and result visualization.

## Project Structure

- `INFY.csv` &mdash; Sample dataset containing Infosys stock price data.
- `requirements.txt` &mdash; List of required Python packages.
